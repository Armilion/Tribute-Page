          <span style="margin-left:2em"></span>Who has never heard of The Undertaker? Despite the cheesy reputation of pro wrestling, this name rings a bell for (almost? maybe?) everyone. The wrestling legend that is also known as The Deadman, The Phenom, The Demon of Death Valley or The American bad-ass, is a character that has been interpreted by Mark Calaway in the WWE. Earlier this year, he announced his retirement, after a 36 years (!) illustrious career and almost 30 loyal to the WWE. Now is a good time to pay tribute to man that may not have saved millions of lives (I'm looking at you Norman Borlaug), but has entertained at least as much. Without further ado, here are the top achievements of The Undertaker' career.
